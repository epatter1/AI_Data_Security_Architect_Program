# 12-week roadmap for AI/Data Security Architect Portfolio

This roadmap is part of a [AI/Data Security Architect Portfolio](https://github.com/epatter1/AI_Data_Security_Architect_Program) designed for hiring managers and clients.

## AI/Data Security Architect Portfolio (AWS | Azure | GCP)

Welcome — this portfolio showcases a glipmse of my abilities as an AI/Data Security Architect, focused on building secure, compliant, and resilient AI systems across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

This repository contains hands‑on labs, reference architectures, governance frameworks, and incident response simulations that demonstrate my ability to:

* Secure AI/ML systems end‑to‑end
* Build multi‑cloud AI security architectures
* Operationalize AI governance and compliance
* Conduct adversarial testing and red teaming
* Protect data pipelines and training environments
* Monitor, detect, and respond to AI‑specific threats
* Each module mirrors how a real enterprise AI Security Program is built — from threat discovery to governance to monitoring.
